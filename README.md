# graphql-react-shop

## Description
This project is an ongoing web application that combines a Spring backend with GraphQL endpoints and a React frontend written in TypeScript. The project focuses on building an admin page for efficient data management on the backend, including the ability to create, update, and delete data.

The backend is developed using Spring, providing a robust infrastructure for server-side operations. GraphQL endpoints are implemented using Spring Boot, enabling flexible data retrieval and manipulation.

The React frontend, built with TypeScript, offers a user-friendly admin page. It facilitates CRUD operations with forms and supports data validation to ensure integrity.

Apollo Client seamlessly integrates with GraphQL to enable efficient communication between the frontend and backend. It simplifies data interactions and updates.

This project aims to streamline backend data management through the admin page, with potential future features such as data visualization and user authentication.
